<H1><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: medium">About XY Graph<BR></SPAN></H1>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: small">XY Graph uses the same syntax analysis as <A href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/123-Calculator-fb96e1b3">123 Calculator</A>, so big parts of the source code are the same. With this syntax analysis XY Graph also can calculate long functions with different exponentations and square roots. Underneath the input for the function in the UI the range of the coordinate system and the score table can be set. The graph of a function is visualized on another tab of the program. A calculated point gets drawn into the GW every 3px and all points get connected. The plotting also considers singularity in a simple way. A simple score table for a function is created on the third tab. XY Graph and the syntax analysis are still under development, so not every plotting might be 100% correct. Please help to improve this program by searching and reporting bugs.</SPAN></P>
