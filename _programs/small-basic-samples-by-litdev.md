<b>This is a selection of fun sample programs for Small Basic (no extensions).</b>

<DIV id=longDesc>
<P>This is a selection of fun sample programs for Small Basic (no extensions).</P>
<P>The download includes Small Basic source code and pdf documentation describing the samples.</P>
<P>Some are short and simple, some are a bit longer, some are a bit educational and some are just for fun.</P>
<P>They are not a complete reference of functionality, nor a set of games that can be run without delving into the code, but rather a somewhat random selection of examples to show how Small Basic can be used.&nbsp; They range from very simple demonstrations of specific features, to ideas for graphical effects and some larger game programs.</P>
<P>They are mostly based on a collection of programs used in connection with the Small Basic forum.&nbsp; Some of them are strongly based on forum member ideas, others I have played with myself or with my children.&nbsp; There are also some dealing with graphics and physics modelling.</P>
<P>They are commented to some extent and generally well structured – some more than others.</P>
<P>They do not cover extensions, however some of them use files; where necessary these files are included.&nbsp; They do not affect any files outside the directory they are copied to – but always check this for yourself before running.</P>
<P>Mainly, they are a set of ideas to play with and see how some common tasks can be performed.</P>
<P>I hope they are useful.</P>
