<b>Just a secret language generator.</b>

<DIV id=longDesc>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: x-large">Hi, I have many times tried unsuccesfully to create my own secret language, so I decided to make my computer do all the work :P </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: x-large">I have here a Language "Generator" that reads from a list of over 80,000 english words. It then creates a word and puts a list of the english words with the new words next to them in the "output" folder. (process takes ~15 minutes, thanks to Florian Auer!)<BR></SPAN></P></DIV>
