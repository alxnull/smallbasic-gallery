<P>The game cannot be played in the gallery list. You must download it (from the Download button above) and play it locally.</P>
<P>Zock did 100% of the coding. Cobra helped make the turret&nbsp;graphics. Zock was the game designer, and Cobra had some gameplay input.</P>
<P>To make the graphics, they used Gimp. They made the corners transparent: <A href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Transparent-Image-Using-Gimp">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Transparent-Image-Using-Gimp</A></P>
