<DIV id=longDesc>
<H1>X-Extension</H1>
<P>Is is an extension set for Small Basic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Objective</H2>
<P>Basically this extension is a solution of things I would like Small Basic to be able to do.</P>
<H2>Last Update</H2>
<P>Uploaded&nbsp;XDialogues.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Recent</H2>
<P>Just completed is the XLeadersBoard object and XDialogues.</P>
<P>This object privides access to one large shared SQLite database. Users can create a table for their game, add a session record and update this record throughout the session.</P>
<P>By using the GetLeaders() method a sorted CSV table is returned with the number of records specified by the programmer.</P>
<P>The database is hosted with a premium host and is interfaced using server side PHP and C# for the extension class.</P>
<P>Please checkout <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: small"><STRONG>TRB403 </STRONG></SPAN>on how you can use the Leaderboard.</P>
<P>I'm currently trialing it with "Step Up to Level 10", a game i've got posted on the gallery.</P>
<H3>Source Code</H3>
<P>Source control is at github.</P>
<P>The above zip download is the dll and XML files that you place in the Small Basic lib folder.</P>
