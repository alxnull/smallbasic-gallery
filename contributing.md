Small Basic Gallery is collecting programs, extensions and tools made for or made with Small Basic.
Therefore, there's always help needed to add new projects or update information on existing projects.

## What to add?

Currently, there are three different collections in the gallery:

- Programs: Software built with Small Basic
- Extensions: Extensions for the Small Basic language
- Tools: Compilers, IDEs and other tools used for developing with Small Basic

**Important: The gallery is collecting software valuable to others. Before adding a new item, please make sure what you want to add is useful to other users or developers.**

## How to add?

Small Basic Gallery is built from a repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/alxnull/smallbasic-gallery).
Each item in the gallery has a description file in this repository.
They are located in the folders `_programs`, `_extensions` and `_tools`, each for one collection.
**To add a new item, start from [this file template](https://github.com/alxnull/smallbasic-gallery/blob/master/TEMPLATES/item-template.md).**
Fill out the required fields and [open a pull request to the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

_Note: Software source code and binaries should not be added directly to the gallery repo.
Create a GitHub repository for your project and link your repository here._
